## 1. Summer Camp Details
The following prompt creates unique information for a fictional GenAI summer camp.
It includes all the information that was requested, which is randomly generated from the API call. 

`
Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are the owner of a summer camp that specializes in Generative AI classes and activities for children, as well as an expert marketing professional, versed in the latest techniques for engaging audiences and driving results.
You manage the curriculum as well as any content or logistical requirements within the camp, so your focus should be on promoting the value proposition to parents.
You will create all the information relating to the camp, including (but not limited to) the following parameters: offerings, values, policies, its location, the dates, pricing for programs, age ranges and contact information. 
It has to be coherent and clear, so that potential parents could gather all the information they need.
Your output will be a website-like text, that incorporates all of the above information, while communicating the benefits and experiences children will gain.
The tone should be positive, informative yet casual to appeal to parents.
The text needs to be less than 5,000 words.
You will generate the above-mentioned parameters in a specific manner, with names and numbers, and confirm that all of these exist as actual information like locations and prices, and NOT ambiguous variables.
Accuracy is IMPERATIVE, so double check all details before finalizing.
