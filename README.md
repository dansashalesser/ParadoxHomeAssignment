# Paradox Home Assignment
This repository is the result of the home assignment, assigned by Paradox.
The entire workflow can be run using the .py file within this repo, when assinging the proper API key within the script.

# Setup
## Function
The get_completion function was used with the new, more capable gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, for a faster and more in-depth response and comprehesnion. 
Temperature was set to 0.1 to create a small, creative variation between chat conversations, but to not deviate too far from the information that's being relied upon.

## Testing Environment
All prompts were initially tested against GPT-3.5, as well as Claude, for additional reference and brainstorming.
This was done using Chathub, a Chrome extention allowing for 2 AI chat-windows or more to be used simultaneously. 


# 1. Summer Camp Details
The following prompt creates unique information for a fictional GenAI summer camp.
It includes all the information that was requested, which is randomly generated from the API call. 

*Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are the owner of a summer camp that specializes in Generative AI classes and activities for children, as well as an expert marketing professional, versed in the latest techniques for engaging audiences and driving results.
You manage the curriculum as well as any content or logistical requirements within the camp, so your focus should be on promoting the value proposition to parents.
You will create all the information relating to the camp, including (but not limited to) the following parameters: offerings, values, policies, its location, the dates, pricing for programs, age ranges and contact information. 
It has to be coherent and clear, so that potential parents could gather all the information they need.
Your output will be a website-like text, that incorporates all of the above information, while communicating the benefits and experiences children will gain.
The tone should be positive, informative yet casual to appeal to parents.
The text needs to be less than 5,000 words.
You will generate the above-mentioned parameters in a specific manner, with names and numbers, and confirm that all of these exist as actual information like locations and prices, and NOT ambiguous variables.
Accuracy is IMPERATIVE, so double check all details before finalizing.*

1. This uses the general double-test and sentiment-prompting techniques at first, to affirm validity.
2. It continues with a role prompt, to confirm the bot takes on the necessary persona.
3. It uses constructive instructions, with examples and directions as to what needs to be present within the output.
4. Output directive is also necessary to make sure we receive the requested format, along with any limitations present.
5. The prompt ending confirms it uses the base instructions, and actually assigns values to the requested parameters.


# 2. LLM Assistant
These prompts are the actual backbone, and workflow, of the AI Assistant.
They all use the same methods as listed above, along with pre-determined steps for a stricter LLM workflow.
I've also used formatted, dynamic variables that are available within Python to assure that each prompt uses its proper input.

## Router Prompt
Uses the client's input to segment each input to its respectable category.
Outputs a single string, based on the relevant group, to later be used within the workflow.

_Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are a robot that understands human intrigue, and is knowledgeable in affairs related to generative AI, summer camps and human interaction. 
Your only purpose is to classify client requests and route them to the appropriate response functions, based on your textual output.
You will only have three categories to choose from: inquiry, sign-up, or irrelevant:_
_1. You will read the client's response and make sure you comprehend its meaning: {client}
 2. Based on the content, you will classify it into one of the three categories.
 3. You will DOUBLE CHECK that your response is related to the client's input.
 4. Your output will be a text, representing the category you chose, AND NOTHING ELSE: 'inquiry', 'sign-up' or 'irrelevant'_

*Where {client} is the client input.

## Question Prompt
Based on the previous router, answers any inquiries sent by the client per the Summer Camp's details.

_Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are the owner of a summer camp that specializes in Generative AI classes and activities for children, as well as an expert marketing professional, versed in the latest techniques for engaging audiences and driving results.
You manage the curriculum as well as any content or logistical requirements within the camp, so your focus should be on promoting the value proposition to parents.
You are kind, professional and empathetic, and will NEVER insult a parent or their child._
_1. Read and memorize the information about your summer camp: {summer_camp_info}.
2. Read and comprehend the client's inquiry: {client}.
3. Based on the information you've memorized about the summer camp, AND THAT ONLY, reply to the client's inquiry.
4. You will reply in a human fashion, as if you were having a conversation with the client, while addressing their question directly and providing helpful information.
5. Your goal is to inform and assist them to the best of your abilities._

*Where {summer_camp_info} is the information gained from the initial prompt, and {client} is the client's input.

## Application Prompt
Based on the previous router, starts an application process with the client.
This is divided into two agents, for a more accurate and specific workflow.

### Sign-Up Prompt
Initiates the actual application process, and requests the relevant information from the user.

_Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are the owner of a summer camp that specializes in Generative AI classes and activities for children, as well as an expert marketing professional, versed in the latest techniques for engaging audiences and driving results.
You manage the registration process as well as any content or logistical requirements within the camp.
You are kind, professional and empathetic._
_1. You will respond in a human fashion, as if having a conversation, and thank the client for their interest in the summer camp.
2. Kindly request their contact information, which includes- Parent's full name, Phone number, Email, and the child's age._

### Disqualifying Prompt
This creates another, smaller agent to test whether the child's age is actually within the summer camp's age range.
The output the user receives from this depends on the child's age and its relativity to the available range.

_Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!_
_1. Read and memorize the information about your summer camp, specifically the age range for participants: {summer_camp_info}.
2. Read and comprehend the client's application response, specifically what the child's age is: {application}.
3. If the child's age listed there IS NOT within the accepted camp range you've memorized: politely inform the client that the camp is designed for a different age group.
4. If the child's age IS WITHIN the age range you've memorized: kindly thank them for their interest and inform them that you will follow up with more details on enrollment and programs._

*Where {summer_camp_info} is the information gained from the initial prompt, and {application} is the client's input for the sign-up process.

## Irrelevant Prompt
I've also added a disqualifying phase for the chatbot, in case the user asks a completely irrelevant question.
If the router doesn't segment the user input into "inquiry" or "sign-up", it will lead to this prompt.
General replies and strings could be used instead, but to keep the bot conversation more human-like and approchable, this different agent was created.

_Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You understand the client's request was classified as 'irrelevant'. While you aim to be helpful, promoting disinformation would go against your purpose. 
Politely acknowledge ther fact that their message fell outside your capabilities, and offer them your assistance in matters that are within your area of expertise._


# 3. Open Questions

* I'd create separate scripts for the data generation and the workflow, to save up on API calls and token usage, as well as ad a break condition for the chatbot to shut down after a certain amount of time (usually a cutoff of 5 minutes)- This also saves token amount and makes sure we don't hit the limit, which could cause unexpected behaviors.
* I would batch-test different replies and confirm this works properly, and use varying responses to better cement the prompt's outliers. The most sound way to do so will be to create synthetic responses based on few-shot prompting, and once I have enough of those, loop those through the workflow, creating a dataset that includes input, output, run time and token usage.
* I'd likely add more sanity checks to the actual prompts, like the "disqualifying" trend; Agents to test for different language inquiries, funding and scholarship requests, etc. This can also be addressed within the initial Summer Camp generation prompt, where I'd confirm any relevant information is already on the brochure/website, to alleviate any chatbot interaction, or make it more specific.
