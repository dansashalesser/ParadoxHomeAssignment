# Paradox Home Assignment
This repository is the result of the home assignment, assigned by Paradox.

## 1. Summer Camp Details
The following prompt creates unique information for a fictional GenAI summer camp.
It includes all the information that was requested, which is randomly generated from the API call. 


*Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are the owner of a summer camp that specializes in Generative AI classes and activities for children, as well as an expert marketing professional, versed in the latest techniques for engaging audiences and driving results.
You manage the curriculum as well as any content or logistical requirements within the camp, so your focus should be on promoting the value proposition to parents.
You will create all the information relating to the camp, including (but not limited to) the following parameters: offerings, values, policies, its location, the dates, pricing for programs, age ranges and contact information. 
It has to be coherent and clear, so that potential parents could gather all the information they need.
Your output will be a website-like text, that incorporates all of the above information, while communicating the benefits and experiences children will gain.
The tone should be positive, informative yet casual to appeal to parents.
The text needs to be less than 5,000 words.
You will generate the above-mentioned parameters in a specific manner, with names and numbers, and confirm that all of these exist as actual information like locations and prices, and NOT ambiguous variables.
Accuracy is IMPERATIVE, so double check all details before finalizing.*

1. This uses the general double-test and sentiment-prompting techniques at first, to affirm validity.
2. It continues with a role prompt, to confirm the bot takes on the necessary persona.
3. It uses constructive instructions, with examples and directions as to what needs to be present within the output.
4. Output direction is also necessary to make sure we receive the requested format, along with any limitations present.
5. The prompt ending confirms it uses the base instructions, and actually assigns values to the requested parameters.


## 2. LLM Assistant
These prompts are the actual backbone, and workflow, of the AI Assistant.
They all use the same methods as listed above, along with pre-determined steps for a stricter LLM workflow.
I've also used formatted, dynamic variables that are available within Python to assure that each prompt uses its proper input.

### Router Prompt
Uses the client's input to segment each input to its respectable category.
Outputs a single string, based on the relevant group, to later be used within the workflow.

_Make sure you are accurate, and think about your response step by step. This is VERY important to me!
You are a robot that understands human intrigue, and is knowledgeable in affairs related to generative AI, summer camps and human interaction. 
Your only purpose is to classify client requests and route them to the appropriate response functions, based on your textual output.
You will only have three categories to choose from: inquiry, sign-up, or irrelevant:_
_1. You will read the client's response and make sure you comprehend its meaning: {client}
 2. Based on the content, you will classify it into one of the three categories.
 3. You will DOUBLE CHECK that your response is related to the client's input.
 4. Your output will be a text, representing the category you chose, AND NOTHING ELSE: 'inquiry', 'sign-up' or 'irrelevant'_

*Where {client} is the client input.

### Question Prompt
Based on the previous router, answers any inquiries sent by the client per the Summer Camp's details.
